## Abstract
Logistics in Sub-Saharan Africa increases the cost of manufactured goods by up to 320% and the inability to communicate an accurate delivery time has a negative impact on the relationship between the company and its customers. In reality, economies are better when logistics is efficient and affordable. To that end, Sendy has intiated a project aimed at accurately predicting the estimated time of delivery of orders, from the point of driver pickup to the point of arrival at final destination. The company has provided historical data with which to develop a solution to the logistics problem with the goal of ensuring effective communication, improved customer relations, cost-efficient services, improved resource management, informed order scheduling and reduced costs for business by finding an effective way of predicting accurate time of arrival to esure that businesses are being better with good logistics.

We have developed an LGBM regressor model and optimal features to realise this solution. This model has been tested on data provided by Sendy and has produced a best root mean square error score of 753.58. The solution will enable Sendy to realise cost savings, and ultimately reduce the cost of doing business, through improved resource management and planning for order scheduling.
